## Simple cross-platform Console IRC Client

Linux
:------------:
 [![Linux Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fredimachado/IRCClient.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fredimachado/IRCClient)
 
This is a fork of Fredimachado's IRCClient.
We used his IRC Client program as the foundation for a 
C++ based IRC Bot. The project is focused completely on our
personal demand for an IRC bot, as well as our desire to 
play with and improve our understanding of C++ and programming
in general. Anyone may use it as per the GNU LGPL. But please
do not expect anything close to polished features at this point. 

- It works on ~~windows and~~ linux (haven't tested on mac)
- Intended to be used as a bot
